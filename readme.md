# DLRA: Dictionary-based Low-Rank Approximation repository

This repository contains the codes for reproducing the dlra package.

It can be easily installed by running from this repository
pip install . -r requirements.txt
but you should install the [mscode package](https://github.com/cohenjer/mscode) manually beforehand.

The web documentation for the package is available under doc/build/html/index.html

This package can be used to reproduce the dictionary-based low-rank approximation experiments from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12399). It contains in dlra/algorithms.py all the dictionary-based low-rank approximation heuristics developed in this reference.

Please cite the arxiv paper if you use this package.
